# Yocto Recipe: hellomakefile

## Description
The "hellomakefile" recipe provides a simple "Hello, World!" program built using a Makefile. This README provides instructions on how to integrate the "hellomakefile" program into a Yocto-based system.

## Prerequisites
- Yocto Project environment set up and initialized
- Access to the Yocto project source files
- Familiarity with Yocto build system concepts
- Makefile for building the "hellomakefile" program

## Usage
To include the "hellomakefile" program in your Yocto image, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Yocto Source Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your Yocto project source files.

### 2. Add Recipe
Add the "hellomakefile" recipe to your Yocto project's layer. You can create a new recipe file or add it to an existing one.

### 3. Provide Makefile
Ensure that the Makefile required to build the "hellomakefile" program is available in the recipe directory or is fetched from a remote source during the recipe's do_fetch task.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example:


Replace `<image-name>` with the name of your desired Yocto image.

### 5. Run Program
After building the Yocto image successfully, you should be able to run the "hellomakefile" program on your target device or emulator.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Makefile provided in the recipe is properly configured to build the "hellomakefile" program.
- Additional customization options for integrating the "hellomakefile" program into the Yocto build system can be explored in the Yocto Project documentation.
