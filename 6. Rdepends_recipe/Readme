# Yocto Recipe: rdepends-example

## Description
The "rdepends-example" recipe demonstrates how to specify runtime dependencies (RDEPENDS) for a Yocto recipe. Runtime dependencies are required for the proper functioning of the software at runtime. This README provides instructions on how to integrate the "rdepends-example" recipe into a Yocto-based system.

## Prerequisites
- Yocto Project environment set up and initialized
- Access to the Yocto project source files
- Familiarity with Yocto build system concepts
- Knowledge of runtime dependencies required by the "rdepends-example" recipe

## Usage
To include the "rdepends-example" recipe in your Yocto image, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Yocto Source Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your Yocto project source files.

### 2. Add Recipe
Add the "rdepends-example" recipe to your Yocto project's layer. You can create a new recipe file or add it to an existing one.

### 3. Specify Runtime Dependencies
In the "rdepends-example" recipe file, specify the runtime dependencies using the appropriate Yocto metadata syntax. For example:
RDEPENDS_${PN} = "dependency1 dependency2"


Replace `dependency1` and `dependency2` with the names of the required runtime dependencies.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example:
bitbake <image-name>


Replace `<image-name>` with the name of your desired Yocto image.

### 5. Verify Runtime Dependencies
After building the Yocto image successfully, verify that the specified runtime dependencies are properly included in the image.

## Notes
- Ensure that all specified runtime dependencies are available in the Yocto build environment during the build process.
- Additional customization options for specifying runtime dependencies and integrating them into the Yocto build system can be explored in the Yocto Project documentation.
