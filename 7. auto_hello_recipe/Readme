# Yocto Recipe: autotools-example

## Description
The "autotools-example" recipe demonstrates how to create a recipe for a software project that utilizes the Autotools build system. This README provides instructions on how to integrate the "autotools-example" recipe into a Yocto-based system.

## Prerequisites
- Yocto Project environment set up and initialized
- Access to the Yocto project source files
- Familiarity with Yocto build system concepts
- Understanding of the Autotools build system used by the software project

## Usage
To include the "autotools-example" recipe in your Yocto image, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Yocto Source Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your Yocto project source files.

### 2. Add Recipe
Add the "autotools-example" recipe to your Yocto project's layer. You can create a new recipe file or add it to an existing one.

### 3. Specify SRC_URI
In the "autotools-example" recipe file, specify the source URI (SRC_URI) for fetching the software project's source code. For example:
SRC_URI = "file://<source-file>"


Replace `<source-file>` with the name of the source file or archive containing the software project's source code.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example:


Replace `<source-file>` with the name of the source file or archive containing the software project's source code.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example:

bitbake <image-name>


Replace `<image-name>` with the name of your desired Yocto image.

### 5. Verify Build
After building the Yocto image successfully, verify that the "autotools-example" recipe is built and included in the image.

## Notes
- Ensure that the software project's build system is properly configured to use Autotools.
- Additional customization options for integrating Autotools-based recipes into the Yocto build system can be explored in the Yocto Project documentation.
