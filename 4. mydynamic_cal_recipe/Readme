# Yocto Recipe: libcalculator

## Description
The "libcalculator" recipe provides a dynamic library containing arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) implemented in `add.c`, `sub.c`, `mul.c`, and `div.c` respectively. Additionally, the library includes a header file `lib_cal.h` defining function prototypes, and a source file `print.c` for printing library information.

The "cal" program (`cal.c`) is a user program that demonstrates the usage of the "libcalculator" library to perform arithmetic operations.

This README provides instructions on how to integrate the "libcalculator" library into a Yocto-based system.

## Prerequisites
- Yocto Project environment set up and initialized
- Access to the Yocto project source files
- Familiarity with Yocto build system concepts

## Usage
To include the "libcalculator" library in your Yocto image, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Yocto Source Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your Yocto project source files.

### 2. Add Recipe
Add the "libcalculator" recipe to your Yocto project's layer. You can create a new recipe file or add it to an existing one.

### 3. Provide Source Files
Ensure that the source files required to build the "libcalculator" library (`add.c`, `sub.c`, `mul.c`, `div.c`, `lib_cal.h`, `print.c`) are available in the recipe directory or are fetched from a remote source during the recipe's do_fetch task.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example: bitbake <recipe-name>
